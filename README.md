Processing sketch based on histograms of iterated chaotic functions

A few years ago I found very nice software tool for generation artwork based on histograms of iterated chaotic functions: Fyre. 
The last version of this tool dated 2011 year. So, I decide to bring this beautiful math to the Processing code.

The idea of the graphic generation is like this:

x' = sin(a * y) - cos(b * x)

y' = sin(c * x) - cos(d * y)

Here it works on Processing.
